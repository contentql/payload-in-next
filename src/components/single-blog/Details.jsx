                  Do you want to know more about the biggest lottery mistakes?
                  One of them is trying to double the winning by gambling. We
                  heard about many lottery winners, who wanted to multiply the
                  money. Their method was very dangerous because it was not an
                  investment. They went to the casino or used the bookmaker and
                  they… lost all the money.
